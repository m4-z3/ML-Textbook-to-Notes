-Human geographers study people and places.
		-The field of human geography focuses on how people make places, how we organize space and society, how we interact with each other in places and across space, and how we make sense of others and ourselves in our localities, regions, and the world.

-Advances in communication and transportation technologies are making places and people more interconnected.
	-Today, we can cross the globe in record time, with easy access to automobiles, airplanes, and ships.

-Aspects of popular culture, such as fashion and architecture, are making many people and places look more alike.
		-Despite all these changes encouraging us to be more alike, our world still encompasses a multitude of ways in which people identify themselves and others.
		-The world consists of nearly 200 countries, a diversity of religions, thousands of languages, and any number of settlement types from small villages to enormous global cities.
		-All of these attributes come together in different ways around the globe to create a world of endlessly diverse places and people.
	-Understanding and explaining this diversity is the mission of human geography.

-The word “globalization” is all around us.
-Globalization is a set of processes that are increasing interactions, deepening relationships, and heightening interdependence without regard to country borders.
		-It is also a set of outcomes that are felt from these global processes—outcomes that are unevenly distributed and differently manifested across the world.

-All too often, discussions of globalization focus on the pull between global—seen as a blanket covering the world—and local—seen as a continuation of the traditional despite the blanket of globalization.
-Geographers are in a place to understand globalization as much more than this.
		-When geographers look at the outcomes of globalization as being distributed unevenly, they are not only talking about the local.
	-Geographers use scale to understand the interrelationships among individual, local, regional, national, and global.
		-What happens at the global scale affects the local, but it also affects the individual, regional and national, and similarly the processes at these scales impact the global.
	-To reduce the world to local and global is to miss much.
-In this book, we study globalization, and we use scale to understand the effects of globalization and the things that shape globalization (see the discussion of scale later in this chapter).

-Globalizing processes occur at the world scale; these processes bypass country borders and include global fi nancial markets or even global environmental change.
		-However, the processes of globalization do not magically appear at the global scale: what happens at other scales (individual, local, regional, national) helps create the processes of globalization and shape the outcomes of globalization.

-Some argue that understanding globalization is critical to understanding the world today, whereas others maintain that globalization is overhyped.
-As geographers Ron Johnston, Peter Taylor, and Michael Watts explain, “Whatever your opinion may be, any intellectual engagement with social change in the twenty fi rst century has to address this concept seriously, and assess its capacity to explain the world we currently inhabit.” We integrate the concept of globalization into this textbook because processes at the global scale and processes that disregard country borders are clearly changing human geography.
-At the same time, as we travel the world and continue to engage in fi eldwork and research, we are constantly reminded how different places and people are—processes at the individual, local, regional, and national scales continue to change human geography and shape globalization.

-No place on Earth is untouched by people.
		-People organize themselves into communities, nations, and broader societal networks, establishing political, economic, religious, linguistic, and cultural systems that enable them to function in space.
	-People adapt to, alter, manipulate, and cope with their physical geographic environment.
	-No environment stands apart from human action.
		-Each place we see is affected by and created by people, and each place refl ects the culture of the people in that place over time.

-Geographers study human phenomena such as language, religion, and identity, and they also study physical phenomena, such as landforms, climate, and environmental change.
		-Human geography is the study of human phenomena on Earth, and physical geography is the study of physical phenomena on Earth.
	-Geographers are trained in studying both the human and physical worlds, but most focus on one more than the other.
	-We ask similar questions but focus on different phenomena.

-Geographer Marvin Mikesell defi ned geography in shorthand as the “why of where.” Why and how do things come together in certain places to produce particular outcomes?
	-To what extent do things in one place infl uence those in other places?
	-To these questions, we add “so what?” Why does it matter that things are different across space?
	-What role does a place play in its region and in the world, and what does that mean for people there and elsewhere?
		-Questions such as these are at the core of geographic inquiry—whether human or physical—and they are of critical importance in any effort to make sense of our world.

-If geography deals with so many aspects of our world, ranging from people and places to coastlines and climates, what do the various facets of this wide-ranging discipline have in common?
		-Whether they are human geographers or physical geographers, virtually all geographers are interested in the spatial arrangement of places and phenomena, how they are laid out, organized, and arranged on the Earth, and how they appear on the landscape.

-Mapping the spatial distribution of a phenomenon is typically the fi rst step to understanding it.
		-By looking at a map of how something is distributed across space, a geographer can raise questions about how the arrangement came about, what processes create and sustain the particular pattern of the distribution, and what relationships exist between different places and things.

-In medical geography, mapping the distribution of a disease is the fi rst step to fi nding its cause.
-Cholera is a term used to denote a set of diseases in which diarrhea and dehydration are the chief symptoms.

-Cholera is an ancient disease and was confi ned to India until the beginning of the nineteenth century.
		-In 1816 it spread to China, Japan, East Africa, and Mediterranean Europe in the fi rst of several pandemics, a worldwide outbreak of the disease.
		-This initial wave abated by 1823, but by then the very name cholera was feared throughout the world, for it had killed people everywhere by the hundreds, even thousands.
-Death was horribly convulsive and would come in a matter of days, perhaps a week, and no one knew what caused the disease or how to avoid it.

-Soon a second cholera pandemic struck.
-It lasted from 1826 to 1837, when cholera crossed the Atlantic and attacked North America.

-When the pandemic that began in 1842 reached England in the 1850s, cholera swept through the Soho District of London.
		-Snow mapped the Soho District, marking all the area’s water pumps—from which people got their water supply for home use—with a P and marking the residence of each person who died from cholera with a dot ( Fig, 1.5 ).
-Approximately 500 deaths occurred in Soho, and as the map took shape, Snow noticed that an especially large number of those deaths clustered around the water pump on Broad Street.
		-At the doctor’s request, city authorities removed the handle from the Broad Street pump, making it impossible to get water from that pump.
-The result was dramatic: almost immediately the number of reported new cases fell to nearly zero.

-Dr.
		-Snow and his colleagues advised people to boil their water, but it would be a long time before his advice reached all those who needed to know, and in any case many people simply did not have the ability to do so.

-Cholera has not been defeated completely, however, and in some ways the risks have been rising in recent years rather than falling ( Fig, 1.6 ).
		-In the teeming shantytowns of the growing cities of the developing world, and in the refugee camps of Africa and Asia, cholera remains a threat.
-Until the 1990s, major outbreaks remained few and limited (after remaining cholera-free for a half century, Europe had its fi rst reappearance of cholera in Naples in 1972), and Africa reported most cases.
-But an outbreak in the slums of Lima, Peru, in December 1990 became a fastspreading epidemic (regional outbreak of a disease) that, though confi ned to the Americas, touched every country in the hemisphere, infected more than 1 million people, and killed over 10,000.
		-When the cholera outbreak occurred in 2006, Angola’s civil war had ended, which allowed people to move around the country easier and helped spread cholera quickly.

-Hygiene prevents cholera, but contaminated water abounds in much of the tropical world’s cities.
	-Dr.
		-Snow achieved a victory through the application of geographical reasoning, but the war against cholera is not yet won.

-The fruits of geographical inquiry were life-saving in this case, but the work of geographers typically goes further in life-understanding.
		-Geographers want to understand why people do different things in different places and how the relationship between people and the physical world varies across space.

-Geography, and being geographically literate, involves much more than memorizing places on a map.
	-History is not merely memorizing dates.
		-To understand history is to appreciate how events, circumstances, and ideas came together at particular times to produce certain outcomes.
		-Knowledge of how events have developed over time is thought to be critical to understanding who we are and where we are going.

-Understanding change over time is critically important, and understanding change across space is equally as important.
		-The great German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that we need disciplines focused not only on particular phenomena (such as economics and sociology), but also on the perspectives of time (history) and space (geography).
-The disciplines of history and geography have intellectual cores defi ned by perspective rather than by subject matter.

-Human geographers use a spatial perspective as they study a multitude of phenomena ranging from political elections and urban shantytowns to gay neighborhoods and folk music.
		-To bring together the many subfi elds of human geography and to explain to nongeographers what geographers do, four major geographical organizations in the United States came together in the 1980s and formed the Geography Educational National Implementation Project.
-The National Geographic Society published their fi ndings in 1986, introducing the five themes of geography.
-The fi ve themes are derived from the spatial perspective of geography.

-The first theme, location, highlights how the geographical position of people and things on the Earth’s surface affects what happens and why.
		-A concern with location underlies almost all geographical work, for location helps to establish the context within which events and processes are situated.

-Some geographers develop elaborate (often quantitative) models describing the locational properties of particular phenomena—even predicting where things are likely to occur.
		-Such undertakings have fostered an interest in location theory, an element of contemporary human geography that seeks answers to a wide range of questions—some of them theoretical, others highly practical: Why are villages, towns, and cities spaced the way they are?
		-A geographer versed in location theory might conclude where a SuperTarget should be built (downtown or in a suburb), given the current neighborhoods and new developments, the median income of the people, the locations of other shopping areas, and the existing and future road system.
-Similarly, a geographer could determine the best location for a wildlife refuge, given existing wildlife habitats and migration patterns, human settlement patterns, and road networks.

-A spatial perspective invites consideration of the relationship among phenomena in individual places—including the relationship between humans and the physical world.
		-Why did the Army Corps of Engineers alter Florida’s physical environment so drastically when they drained part of the Everglades?
-Have the changes in Florida’s environment created an easier path of destruction for hurricanes?
		-Why is the Army Corps of Engineers again changing the course of the Kissimmee River, and what does that mean for farmers around the river and residential developments in the south of Florida?
-Geographers study the reciprocal relationship between humans and environments.

-The third theme of geography is the region.
	-Instead, features tend to be concentrated in particular areas, which we call regions.
		-Geographers use fieldwork, quantitative, and qualitative methods to develop insightful descriptions of different regions of the world.
-Novelist James Michener once wrote that whenever he started writing a new book, he fi rst prepared himself by turning to books written by regional geographers about the area where the action was to occur.
-Understanding the regional geography of a place allows us to make sense of much of the information we have about places and digest new information about places as well.

-The fourth theme is represented by the seemingly simple word place.
		-All places on the surface of the Earth have unique human and physical characteristics, and one of the purposes of geography is to study the special character and meaning of places.
		-People develop a sense of place by infusing a place with meaning and emotion, by remembering important events that occurred in a place, or by labeling a place with a certain character.
	-Because we experience and give meaning to places, we can have a feeling of “home,” when we are in a certain place.

-We also develop perceptions of places we have never been through books, movies, stories, and pictures.
		-Geographers Peter Gould and Rodney White asked college students in California and Pennsylvania: “If you could move to any place of your choice, without any of the usual fi nancial and other obstacles, where would you like to live?” Their responses showed a strong bias for their home region and revealed that students from both regions had negative perceptions of the South, Appalachia, the Great Plains, and Utah ( Fig, 1.7 ).

-The fifth theme, movement, refers to the mobility of people, goods, and ideas across the surface of the planet.
		-Spatial interaction between places depends on the distances (the measured physical space between two places) among places, the accessibility (the ease of reaching one location from another) of places, and the transportation and communication connectivity (the degree of linkage between locations in a network) among places.
		-Interactions of many kinds shape the human geography of the world, and understanding these interactions is an important aspect of the global spatial order.

-In addition to the five themes—location, human-environment, region, place, and movement—landscape is a core element of geography.
		-Geographers use the term landscape to refer to the material character of a place, the complex of natural features, human structures, and other tangible objects that give a place a particular form.
		-Human geographers are particularly concerned with the cultural landscape, the visible imprint of human activity on the landscape.
		-The geographer whose name is most closely identifi ed with this concept is former University of California at Berkeley professor Carl Sauer.
-In 1927, Sauer wrote an article entitled “Recent Developments in Cultural Geography,” in which he argued that cultural landscapes are comprised of the “forms superimposed on the physical landscape” by human activity.

-No place on Earth is in a “pristine” condition— humans have made an imprint on every place on the planet ( Fig, 1.8 ).
		-We can see the cultural landscape in the layers of buildings, roads, memorials, churches, fi elds, and homes that human activities over time have imprinted on the landscape.

-Any cultural landscape has layers of imprints from years of human activity.
		-As each group of people arrived and occupied a place, they brought their own technological  and cultural traditions and transformed the landscape accordingly.
		-Each new group of residents can also be infl uenced by what they fi nd when they arrive—and leave some of it in place.
-In 1929, Derwent Whittlesey proposed the term sequent occupance to refer to these sequential imprints of occupants, whose impacts are layered one on top of the other.

-The Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam provides an interesting urban example of sequent occupance.
-Next, German colonizers imprinted a new layout and architectural style (wood-beamed Teutonic) when they chose the city as the center of their East African colonies in 1891.
		-After World War I, when the Germans were ousted, a British administration took over the city and began yet another period of transformation.
-The British encouraged immigration from their colony in India to Tanzania.
		-The new migrant Asian population created a zone of three- and four-story apartment houses, which look as if they were transplanted from Bombay, India ( Fig, 1.9left and right).
	-Then, in the early 1960s, Dar es Salaam became the capital of newly independent Tanzania.
-Thus, the city experienced four stages of cultural dominance in less than one century, and each stage of the sequence remains imprinted in the cultural landscape.

-The cultural landscape can be seen as a kind of book offering clues into each chapter of the cultural practices, values, and priorities of its various occupiers.
		-As geographer Peirce Lewis explained in Axioms for Reading the Landscape (1979), “Our human landscape is our unwitting autobiography, refl ecting our tastes, our values, our aspirations, and even our fears, in tangible, visible form.” Like Whittlesey, Lewis recommended looking for layers of history in cultural landscapes, adding that most major changes in the cultural landscape occur after a major event—a war, an invention, an economic depression.

-Maps are an incredibly powerful geographic tool, and cartography, the art and science of making maps, is as old as geography itself.
-Maps are used for countless purposes—to wage war, make political propaganda, solve medical problems, locate shopping centers, bring relief to refugees, and warn of natural hazards.
-Reference maps show locations of places and geographic features.
		-Thematic maps tell stories, typically showing the degree of some attribute or the movement of a geographic phenomenon.

-Reference maps focus on accuracy in showing the absolute locations of places, using a coordinate system that allows you to plot precisely where on Earth something is.
		-Imagine taking an orange, drawing a dot on it with a marker, and then trying to describe the exact location of that dot to someone who is holding another orange so she can mark the same spot on her orange.
		-If you draw and number the same coordinate system on both oranges, the task of drawing the absolute location on each orange is not only doable but is simple.
		-Plotting absolute locations to make a reference map is simple with the use of a coordinate system, and the system most frequently used is latitude and longitude.
-For example, the absolute location of Chicago is 41 degrees, 53 minutes North Latitude and 87 degrees, 38 minutes West Longitude.
-Using these coordinates, you can plot Chicago on any globe or map that is marked with latitude and longitude.

-The establishment of satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) allows us to locate things on the surface of the Earth with extraordinary accuracy.
		-Researchers collect data quickly and easily in the fi eld, and low-priced units are encouraging fishers, hunters, and hikers to use GPS in their hobbies.
-New cars are equipped with GPS units, and dashboard map displays help commuters navigate traffi c and travelers fi nd their way.
-Geocaching is a new hobby based on the use of GPS.
	-People leave the treasures (“caches”) somewhere, mark the coordinates on their GPS, and post clues on the Internet.
	-If you fi nd the cache, you take the treasure and leave a new one.

-Relative location describes a place in relation to other human and physical features.
		-Descriptors such as “Chicago is on Lake Michigan, south of Milwaukee” or “Chicago is located where the cross-country railroads met in the 1800s” or “Chicago is the hub of the corn and soybean markets in the Midwest” are all descriptors of Chicago relative to other features.
	-In the southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and western Indiana region, all roads lead to Chicago ( Fig, 1.10 ).
		-Within this region, people defi ne much of their lives relative to Chicago because of the tight interconnectedness between Chicago and the region.
-Northwestern Indiana is so connected to Chicago that they have a time zone separate from the rest of Indiana—allowing people in northwestern Indiana to stay in the same time zone as Chicago.

-Absolute locations do not change, but relative locations are constantly modifi ed and change over time.
		-Today, it is a suburb of Washington, D.C., with commuter trains, van pools, buses, and cars moving commuters between their homes in Fredericksburg and their workplaces in metropolitan Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, several bloody battles took place in Fredericksburg as the North and South fought over the land halfway between their wartime capitals.
-The absolute location of Fredericksburg has not changed, but its place in the world around it, its relative location, certainly has.

-We all carry maps in our minds of places we have been and places we have merely heard of; these are called mental maps.
-Even if you have never been to the Great Plains of the United States, you may have studied wall maps and atlases or come across the region in books, magazines, and newspapers frequently enough to envision the states of the region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas) in your mind.
		-If you hear on the news that a tornado destroyed a town in Oklahoma, you use your mental map of the Great Plains region and Oklahoma to make sense of where the tornado occurred and who was impacted.

-Our mental maps of the places within our activity spaces, those places we travel to routinely in our rounds of daily activity, are more accurate and detailed than places we have never been.
		-If your friend calls and asks you to meet her at the movie theater you go to all the time, your mental map will engage automatically.
-You will envision the hallway, the front door, the walk to your car, the lane to choose in order to be prepared for the left turn you must make, where you will park your car, and your path into the theater and up to the popcorn stand.

-Geographers who study human–environment behavior have made extensive studies of how people develop their mental maps.
	-Today, people need mental maps to fi nd their way through the concrete jungles of cities and suburbs.

-Geographers have studied the mental map formation of children, the blind, new residents to cities, men, and women, all of whom exhibit differences in the formation of mental maps.
-Activity spaces vary by age, and the extent of peoples’ mental maps depends in part on their ages.
-Mental maps include terra incognita, unknown lands that are off-limits.
		-If your path to the movie theater includes driving past a school that you do not go to, your map on paper will likely label the school, but no details will be shown regarding the place.
		-However, if you have access to the school and you are instead drawing a mental map of how to get to the school’s cafeteria, your mental map of the school will be quite detailed.
-Thus, mental maps refl ect a person’s activity space, what is accessible to the person in his or her rounds of daily activity and what is not.

-All maps simplify the world.
		-A reference map of the world cannot show every place in the world, and a thematic map of hurricane tracks in the Atlantic Ocean cannot pinpoint every hurricane and its precise path for the last 50 years.
		-When mapping data, whether human or physical, cartographers, the geographers who make maps, generalize the information they present on maps.
	-Many of the maps in this book are thematic maps of the world.
	-Shadings show how much or how little of some phenomena can be found on a part of the Earth’s surface.

-Generalized maps help us see general trends, but we cannot see all cases of a given phenomenon.
		-The map of world precipitation ( Fig, 1.11 ) is a generalized map of mean annual precipitation received around the world.
		-The areas shaded burgundy, dark blue, and vibrant green are places that receive the most rain, and those shaded in orange receive the least rain on average.
	-Take a pen and trace along the equator on the map.
-Notice how many of the high-precipitation areas on the map are along the equator.
		-The consistent heating of the equator over the course of the entire year brings consistent precipitation to the equatorial region.
-At the scale of the world, we can see general trends in precipitation, such as this, but it is diffi cult to see the microscale climates of intense precipitation areas everywhere in the world.

-Geographic studies include both long- and short-term environmental change.
		-Geographers monitor the Earth from a distance, using remote sensing, using technology that is a distance away from the place being studied.
		-Remotely sensed data are collected by satellites and aircraft (airplanes, balloons) and are almost instantaneously available.
-After a major weather event, such as the 2008 fl oods in the Mississippi River Valley or the unprecedented hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005, remotely sensed data show us the major areas of impact ( Fig, 1.12 ).
-A remotely sensed image highlights the eye of a hurricane, and photos taken on the ground show the impact and destruction ( Fig, 1.13 ).

-In a government that is harming its citizens or that will not reliably allow foreign aid to help its citizens, remote sensing helps geographers understand the physical and human geography of the place.
-Google Earth is a free, web-based user-friendly set of remotely sensed images from around the world woven together and accessible to anyone with Internet access.
-You can think of Google Earth as a quilt of remotely sensed images, taken all over the world, coming from several sources, and sewn together—like a patchwork quilt.
		-As a result, the resolution (the measure of the smallest object that can be esolved by the sensor, the degree of detail) of the images (each piece of the quilt) differs.

-Remotely sensed images can be incorporated in a map, and absolute locations can be studied over time by plotting change in remotely sensed images for one place over time.
		-Advances in computer technology and data storage, increasing accessibility to locationally based data and GPS technology, and software corporations that tailor products to specifi c uses have all driven incredible advances in geographic information systems (GIS) over the last two decades.
-Geographers use GIS to compare a variety of spatial data by creating digitized representations of the environment ( Fig, 1.14 ), combining layers of spatial data, and creating maps in which patterns and processes are superimposed.

-Geographers use GIS for applications in both human and physical geographic research.
		-For example, political geographers use GIS to map layers showing voters, their party registration, their race, their likelihood of voting, and their income in order to determine how to draw voting districts in congressional and state legislative elections.
-In this case, a geographer can draw a line around a group of people and ask the computer program to tally how many voters are inside the region, determine what the racial composition is of the district, and show how many of the current political representatives live within the new district’s boundaries.

-Geographers trained in GIS apply the software technologies in countless fields today.
-Students who earn undergraduate degrees in geography are employed by software companies, government agencies, and businesses to use GIS in surveying wildlife, mapping soils, analyzing natural disasters, following diseases, assisting fi rst responders, planning cities, plotting transportation improvements, and tracking weather systems.
-For example, a group of geographers working for one GIS company tailors the GIS software to serve the branches of the military and the defense intelligence community.
		-The vast amounts of intelligence data gathered by the various intelligence agencies can be integrated into a GIS and then analyzed spatially.
		-Geographers working in the defense intelligence community can use GIS to query a vast amount of intelligence, interpret spatial data, and make recommendations on issues of security and defense.

-The amount of data digestible in a GIS, the power of the location analysis possible with computer hardware, and the ease of analysis with GIS software applications allow geographers to answer complicated questions using GIS.
-For example, geographer Korine Kolivras analyzed the probability of dengue fever outbreaks in Hawaii using GIS ( Fig, 1.15 ).
		-The maps Kolivras produced may look as simple and straightforward as the cholera maps produced by Dr. John Snow in the 1800s, but the amount of data that went into Kolivras’s analysis is staggering in comparison.
	-Dengue fever is carried by a particular kind of mosquito called the Aedes mosquito.
		-Kolivras analyzed the breeding conditions needed for the Aedes mosquito, including precipitation, topography, and several other variables, to predict what places in Hawaii are most likely to experience an outbreak of dengue fever.

-A new term of art used in geography is GISc.
		-Geographic information science (GISc) is an emerging research fi eld concerned with studying the development and use of geospatial concepts and techniques to examine geographic patterns and processes.
		-Your school may have a program in GISc that draws across disciplines, bringing together the computer scientists who write the programs, the engineers who create sensors that gather data about the Earth, and the geographers who combine layers of data and interpret them to make sense of our world.

-Geographers study places and patterns at a variety of scales, including local, regional, national, and global.
		-Scale has two meanings in geography: the fi rst is the distance on a map compared to the distance on the Earth, and the second is the territorial extent of something.
	-Throughout the book, when we refer to scale we are using the second of these defi nitions.
		-As geographers, the scale of our research or analysis matters because we can make different observations at different scales.
		-We can study a single phenomenon across different scales in order to see how what is happening at the global scale affects localities and how what is happening at a local scale affects the globe.
		-Geographers recognize that phenomena, whether human or physical, happen in a context and that the context looks different at different scales.

-The scale at which we study a geographic phenomenon tells us what level of detail we can expect to see.
		-For example, when we study the distribution of wealth at the scale of the globe (see Fig, 1.3 ), we see the countries in western Europe, Canada, the United States, Japan, and Australia are the wealthiest, and the countries of Subsaharan Africa and Southeast Asia are the poorest.
	-Does that mean everyone in the United States is wealthy and everyone in Indonesia is poor?
	-Certainly not, but on a global-scale map of states, that is how the data appear.

-When you shift scales to North America and examine the data for States of the United States and the provinces of Canada ( Fig, 1.16 ), you see that the wealthiest areas are on the coasts and the poorest are in the interior and in the extreme northeast and south.
		-The State of Alaska and the province of the Northwest Territories have high gross per capita incomes that stem largely from oil revenues that are shared among the residents.

-Shifting scales again to just one city, for example, metropolitan Washington, D.C. ( Fig, 1.17 ), you observe that suburbs west, northwest, and southwest of the city show the greatest wealth and that suburbs east and southeast have lower income levels.
-In the city itself, a clear dichotomy of wealth divides the northwest neighborhoods from the rest of the city.
		-Shifting scales again to the individual, if we conducted fi eldwork in Washington, DC and interviewed people who live below the poverty line, we would quickly fi nd that each person’s experience of poverty and reasons for being in poverty vary—making it diffi cult to generalize.
-We would fi nd some trends, such as how women in poverty who have children cope differently than single men or how illegal immigrants cope differently from legal immigrants.

-Because the level of detail and the patterns observed change as the scale changes, geographers must be sensitive to their scale of analysis and also be wary of researchers who make generalizations about a people or a place at a particular scale without considering other scales of analysis.

-Geographers’ concern with scale goes beyond an interest in the scale of individual phenomena to a concern with how processes operating at different scales influence one another.
		-If you want to understand the conflict between the Tutsi and the Hutu people in Rwanda, for example, you cannot look solely at this African country.
		-The Rwandan confl ict is infl uenced by developments at a variety of different scales, including patterns of migration and interaction in Central Africa, the economic and political relations between Rwanda and parts of Europe, and the variable impacts of globalization—economic, political, and cultural.

-Geographers are also interested in how people use scale politically.
		-Local political movements, such as like the Zapatistas in southern Mexico, have learned to rescale their actions—to involve players at other scales and create a global outcry of support for their position.
		-By taking their political campaign from the individual and local scale to the national scale through their protests against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and then effectively using the Internet to wage a global campaign, the Zapatistas gained attention from the world media, a feat few local political movements achieve.
