[['Human geographers study people and places.', 'The field of human geography focuses on how people make places, how we organize space and society, how we interact with each other in places and across space, and how we make sense of others and ourselves in our localities, regions, and the world.']]

[['Advances in communication and transportation technologies are making places and people more interconnected.', 'Only 100 years ago, the fastest modes of transportation were the steamship, the railroad, and the horse and buggy.', 'Today, we can cross the globe in record time, with easy access to automobiles, airplanes, and ships.']]

[['Aspects of popular culture, such as fashion and architecture, are making many people and places look more alike.', 'Despite all these changes encouraging us to be more alike, our world still encompasses a multitude of ways in which people identify themselves and others.', 'The world consists of nearly 200 countries, a diversity of religions, thousands of languages, and any number of settlement types from small villages to enormous global cities.', 'All of these attributes come together in different ways around the globe to create a world of endlessly diverse places and people.', 'Understanding and explaining this diversity is the mission of human geography.']]

[['The word “globalization” is all around us.', 'To make sense of this phenomenon, we fi rst need to defi ne it.'], ['Globalization is a set of processes that are increasing interactions, deepening relationships, and heightening interdependence without regard to country borders.', 'It is also a set of outcomes that are felt from these global processes—outcomes that are unevenly distributed and differently manifested across the world.']]

[['All too often, discussions of globalization focus on the pull between global—seen as a blanket covering the world—and local—seen as a continuation of the traditional despite the blanket of globalization.'], ['Geographers are in a place to understand globalization as much more than this.', 'When geographers look at the outcomes of globalization as being distributed unevenly, they are not only talking about the local.', 'Geographers use scale to understand the interrelationships among individual, local, regional, national, and global.', 'What happens at the global scale affects the local, but it also affects the individual, regional and national, and similarly the processes at these scales impact the global.', 'To reduce the world to local and global is to miss much.'], ['In this book, we study globalization, and we use scale to understand the effects of globalization and the things that shape globalization (see the discussion of scale later in this chapter).']]
