26: [['A spatial perspective invites consideration of the relationship among phenomena in individual places—including the relationship between humans and the physical world.', 'Thus, the second of the fi ve themes concerns human–environment interactions.', 'Why did the Army Corps of Engineers alter Florida’s physical environment so drastically when they drained part of the Everglades?'], ['Have the changes in Florida’s environment created an easier path of destruction for hurricanes?', 'Why is the Army Corps of Engineers again changing the course of the Kissimmee River, and what does that mean for farmers around the river and residential developments in the south of Florida?'], ['Geographers study the reciprocal relationship between humans and environments.']]

27: [['The third theme of geography is the region.', 'Phenomena are not evenly distributed on the surface of the Earth.', 'Instead, features tend to be concentrated in particular areas, which we call regions.', 'Geographers use fieldwork, quantitative, and qualitative methods to develop insightful descriptions of different regions of the world.'], ['Novelist James Michener once wrote that whenever he started writing a new book, he fi rst prepared himself by turning to books written by regional geographers about the area where the action was to occur.'], ['Understanding the regional geography of a place allows us to make sense of much of the information we have about places and digest new information about places as well.']]

28: [['The fourth theme is represented by the seemingly simple word place.', 'All places on the surface of the Earth have unique human and physical characteristics, and one of the purposes of geography is to study the special character and meaning of places.', 'People develop a sense of place by infusing a place with meaning and emotion, by remembering important events that occurred in a place, or by labeling a place with a certain character.', 'Because we experience and give meaning to places, we can have a feeling of “home,” when we are in a certain place.']]

29: [['We also develop perceptions of places we have never been through books, movies, stories, and pictures.', 'Geographers Peter Gould and Rodney White asked college students in California and Pennsylvania: “If you could move to any place of your choice, without any of the usual fi nancial and other obstacles, where would you like to live?” Their responses showed a strong bias for their home region and revealed that students from both regions had negative perceptions of the South, Appalachia, the Great Plains, and Utah ( Fig.', '1.7 ).']]

30: [['The fifth theme, movement, refers to the mobility of people, goods, and ideas across the surface of the planet.'], ['Movement is an expression of the interconnectedness of places.', 'Spatial interaction between places depends on the distances (the measured physical space between two places) among places, the accessibility (the ease of reaching one location from another) of places, and the transportation and communication connectivity (the degree of linkage between locations in a network) among places.'], ['Interactions of many kinds shape the human geography of the world, and understanding these interactions is an important aspect of the global spatial order.']]

31: [['In addition to the five themes—location, human-environment, region, place, and movement—landscape is a core element of geography.', 'Geographers use the term landscape to refer to the material character of a place, the complex of natural features, human structures, and other tangible objects that give a place a particular form.', 'Human geographers are particularly concerned with the cultural landscape, the visible imprint of human activity on the landscape.', 'The geographer whose name is most closely identifi ed with this concept is former University of California at Berkeley professor Carl Sauer.'], ['In 1927, Sauer wrote an article entitled “Recent Developments in Cultural Geography,” in which he argued that cultural landscapes are comprised of the “forms superimposed on the physical landscape” by human activity.']]

32: [['No place on Earth is in a “pristine” condition— humans have made an imprint on every place on the planet ( Fig.', '1.8 ).', 'The cultural landscape is the visible imprint of human activity and culture on the landscape.', 'We can see the cultural landscape in the layers of buildings, roads, memorials, churches, fi elds, and homes that human activities over time have imprinted on the landscape.']]

33: [['Any cultural landscape has layers of imprints from years of human activity.', 'As each group of people arrived and occupied a place, they brought their own technological  and cultural traditions and transformed the landscape accordingly.', 'Each new group of residents can also be infl uenced by what they fi nd when they arrive—and leave some of it in place.'], ['In 1929, Derwent Whittlesey proposed the term sequent occupance to refer to these sequential imprints of occupants, whose impacts are layered one on top of the other.']]

34: [['The Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam provides an interesting urban example of sequent occupance.', 'Arabs from Zanzibar fi rst chose the African site in 1866 as a summer retreat.'], ['Next, German colonizers imprinted a new layout and architectural style (wood-beamed Teutonic) when they chose the city as the center of their East African colonies in 1891.', 'After World War I, when the Germans were ousted, a British administration took over the city and began yet another period of transformation.'], ['The British encouraged immigration from their colony in India to Tanzania.', 'The new migrant Asian population created a zone of three- and four-story apartment houses, which look as if they were transplanted from Bombay, India ( Fig.', '1.9left and right).', 'Then, in the early 1960s, Dar es Salaam became the capital of newly independent Tanzania.'], ['Thus, the city experienced four stages of cultural dominance in less than one century, and each stage of the sequence remains imprinted in the cultural landscape.']]

35: [['The cultural landscape can be seen as a kind of book offering clues into each chapter of the cultural practices, values, and priorities of its various occupiers.', 'As geographer Peirce Lewis explained in Axioms for Reading the Landscape (1979), “Our human landscape is our unwitting autobiography, refl ecting our tastes, our values, our aspirations, and even our fears, in tangible, visible form.” Like Whittlesey, Lewis recommended looking for layers of history in cultural landscapes, adding that most major changes in the cultural landscape occur after a major event—a war, an invention, an economic depression.']]

18: [['Cholera has not been defeated completely, however, and in some ways the risks have been rising in recent years rather than falling ( Fig.', '1.6 ).', 'In the teeming shantytowns of the growing cities of the developing world, and in the refugee camps of Africa and Asia, cholera remains a threat.'], ['Until the 1990s, major outbreaks remained few and limited (after remaining cholera-free for a half century, Europe had its fi rst reappearance of cholera in Naples in 1972), and Africa reported most cases.'], ['But an outbreak in the slums of Lima, Peru, in December 1990 became a fastspreading epidemic (regional outbreak of a disease) that, though confi ned to the Americas, touched every country in the hemisphere, infected more than 1 million people, and killed over 10,000.', 'In 2006, a cholera outbreak in Angola spread quickly throughout the country.', 'When the cholera outbreak occurred in 2006, Angola’s civil war had ended, which allowed people to move around the country easier and helped spread cholera quickly.']]

19: [['Hygiene prevents cholera, but contaminated water abounds in much of the tropical world’s cities.', 'A cholera vaccine exists, but it remains effective for only six months, and it is costly.', 'Dr.', 'Snow achieved a victory through the application of geographical reasoning, but the war against cholera is not yet won.']]

20: [['The fruits of geographical inquiry were life-saving in this case, but the work of geographers typically goes further in life-understanding.', 'Geographers want to understand why people do different things in different places and how the relationship between people and the physical world varies across space.']]

21: [['Geography, and being geographically literate, involves much more than memorizing places on a map.', 'In this sense, the disciplines of geography and history have much in common.', 'History is not merely memorizing dates.', 'To understand history is to appreciate how events, circumstances, and ideas came together at particular times to produce certain outcomes.', 'Knowledge of how events have developed over time is thought to be critical to understanding who we are and where we are going.']]

22: [['Understanding change over time is critically important, and understanding change across space is equally as important.', 'The great German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that we need disciplines focused not only on particular phenomena (such as economics and sociology), but also on the perspectives of time (history) and space (geography).'], ['The disciplines of history and geography have intellectual cores defi ned by perspective rather than by subject matter.']]

23: [['Human geographers use a spatial perspective as they study a multitude of phenomena ranging from political elections and urban shantytowns to gay neighborhoods and folk music.', 'To bring together the many subfi elds of human geography and to explain to nongeographers what geographers do, four major geographical organizations in the United States came together in the 1980s and formed the Geography Educational National Implementation Project.'], ['The National Geographic Society published their fi ndings in 1986, introducing the five themes of geography.'], ['The fi ve themes are derived from the spatial perspective of geography.']]

24: [['The first theme, location, highlights how the geographical position of people and things on the Earth’s surface affects what happens and why.', 'A concern with location underlies almost all geographical work, for location helps to establish the context within which events and processes are situated.']]

25: [['Some geographers develop elaborate (often quantitative) models describing the locational properties of particular phenomena—even predicting where things are likely to occur.', 'Such undertakings have fostered an interest in location theory, an element of contemporary human geography that seeks answers to a wide range of questions—some of them theoretical, others highly practical: Why are villages, towns, and cities spaced the way they are?'], ['A geographer versed in location theory might conclude where a SuperTarget should be built (downtown or in a suburb), given the current neighborhoods and new developments, the median income of the people, the locations of other shopping areas, and the existing and future road system.', 'Similarly, a geographer could determine the best location for a wildlife refuge, given existing wildlife habitats and migration patterns, human settlement patterns, and road networks.']]

26: [['A spatial perspective invites consideration of the relationship among phenomena in individual places—including the relationship between humans and the physical world.', 'Thus, the second of the fi ve themes concerns human–environment interactions.', 'Why did the Army Corps of Engineers alter Florida’s physical environment so drastically when they drained part of the Everglades?'], ['Have the changes in Florida’s environment created an easier path of destruction for hurricanes?', 'Why is the Army Corps of Engineers again changing the course of the Kissimmee River, and what does that mean for farmers around the river and residential developments in the south of Florida?'], ['Geographers study the reciprocal relationship between humans and environments.']]

27: [['The third theme of geography is the region.', 'Phenomena are not evenly distributed on the surface of the Earth.', 'Instead, features tend to be concentrated in particular areas, which we call regions.', 'Geographers use fieldwork, quantitative, and qualitative methods to develop insightful descriptions of different regions of the world.'], ['Novelist James Michener once wrote that whenever he started writing a new book, he fi rst prepared himself by turning to books written by regional geographers about the area where the action was to occur.'], ['Understanding the regional geography of a place allows us to make sense of much of the information we have about places and digest new information about places as well.']]

28: [['The fourth theme is represented by the seemingly simple word place.', 'All places on the surface of the Earth have unique human and physical characteristics, and one of the purposes of geography is to study the special character and meaning of places.', 'People develop a sense of place by infusing a place with meaning and emotion, by remembering important events that occurred in a place, or by labeling a place with a certain character.', 'Because we experience and give meaning to places, we can have a feeling of “home,” when we are in a certain place.']]

29: [['We also develop perceptions of places we have never been through books, movies, stories, and pictures.', 'Geographers Peter Gould and Rodney White asked college students in California and Pennsylvania: “If you could move to any place of your choice, without any of the usual fi nancial and other obstacles, where would you like to live?” Their responses showed a strong bias for their home region and revealed that students from both regions had negative perceptions of the South, Appalachia, the Great Plains, and Utah ( Fig.', '1.7 ).']]

30: [['The fifth theme, movement, refers to the mobility of people, goods, and ideas across the surface of the planet.'], ['Movement is an expression of the interconnectedness of places.', 'Spatial interaction between places depends on the distances (the measured physical space between two places) among places, the accessibility (the ease of reaching one location from another) of places, and the transportation and communication connectivity (the degree of linkage between locations in a network) among places.'], ['Interactions of many kinds shape the human geography of the world, and understanding these interactions is an important aspect of the global spatial order.']]

31: [['In addition to the five themes—location, human-environment, region, place, and movement—landscape is a core element of geography.', 'Geographers use the term landscape to refer to the material character of a place, the complex of natural features, human structures, and other tangible objects that give a place a particular form.', 'Human geographers are particularly concerned with the cultural landscape, the visible imprint of human activity on the landscape.', 'The geographer whose name is most closely identifi ed with this concept is former University of California at Berkeley professor Carl Sauer.'], ['In 1927, Sauer wrote an article entitled “Recent Developments in Cultural Geography,” in which he argued that cultural landscapes are comprised of the “forms superimposed on the physical landscape” by human activity.']]

32: [['No place on Earth is in a “pristine” condition— humans have made an imprint on every place on the planet ( Fig.', '1.8 ).', 'The cultural landscape is the visible imprint of human activity and culture on the landscape.', 'We can see the cultural landscape in the layers of buildings, roads, memorials, churches, fi elds, and homes that human activities over time have imprinted on the landscape.']]

33: [['Any cultural landscape has layers of imprints from years of human activity.', 'As each group of people arrived and occupied a place, they brought their own technological  and cultural traditions and transformed the landscape accordingly.', 'Each new group of residents can also be infl uenced by what they fi nd when they arrive—and leave some of it in place.'], ['In 1929, Derwent Whittlesey proposed the term sequent occupance to refer to these sequential imprints of occupants, whose impacts are layered one on top of the other.']]

34: [['The Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam provides an interesting urban example of sequent occupance.', 'Arabs from Zanzibar fi rst chose the African site in 1866 as a summer retreat.'], ['Next, German colonizers imprinted a new layout and architectural style (wood-beamed Teutonic) when they chose the city as the center of their East African colonies in 1891.', 'After World War I, when the Germans were ousted, a British administration took over the city and began yet another period of transformation.'], ['The British encouraged immigration from their colony in India to Tanzania.', 'The new migrant Asian population created a zone of three- and four-story apartment houses, which look as if they were transplanted from Bombay, India ( Fig.', '1.9left and right).', 'Then, in the early 1960s, Dar es Salaam became the capital of newly independent Tanzania.'], ['Thus, the city experienced four stages of cultural dominance in less than one century, and each stage of the sequence remains imprinted in the cultural landscape.']]

35: [['The cultural landscape can be seen as a kind of book offering clues into each chapter of the cultural practices, values, and priorities of its various occupiers.', 'As geographer Peirce Lewis explained in Axioms for Reading the Landscape (1979), “Our human landscape is our unwitting autobiography, refl ecting our tastes, our values, our aspirations, and even our fears, in tangible, visible form.” Like Whittlesey, Lewis recommended looking for layers of history in cultural landscapes, adding that most major changes in the cultural landscape occur after a major event—a war, an invention, an economic depression.']]
